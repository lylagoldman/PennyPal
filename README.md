PennyPal is a student-focused expense tracking app built with Swift and SwiftUI. The goal of PennyPal is to help college students easily track daily spending and build healthier money habits in a simple, friendly interface.

This project is in progress. The current version includes the login screen UI. Future work will include expense tracking and data persistence.

PennyPal was created as a learning project to practice iOS development while building something useful for college students managing tight budgets.
